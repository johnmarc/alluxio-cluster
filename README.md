### ALLUXIO ON DOCKER FOR MARATHON

This an updated version of [ajmssc](https://github.com/ajmssc)'s [repo](https://github.com/ajmssc/alluxio-cluster). It's been updated to use version 1.2.0/1.4.0 of Alluxio and to work with Marathon (which doesn't use Docker compose).

The docker image is located at https://hub.docker.com/r/koddidev/alluxio/

Coming soon: our blog will have instructions for setting up the Marathon cluster with this container.
